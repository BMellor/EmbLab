Pre-lab Questions:
----------------------------

List two things you can learn from a peripheral's functional description in the peripheral reference manual? 

What is the title of the first sub-section in the functional description of timers 2 and 3? (Not mentioned in lab manual, look it up!)

What is the purpose of the Prescaler (PSC) register?

What is the purpose of the Auto-Reload (ARR) register?

What is the purpose of the Capture/Compare (CCRx) register while the timer is operating in Output Compare mode? 

What does the duty-cycle of a PWM signal represent?

What is the purpose of the Alternate Function mode for a GPIO pin? 

In what document can you find the documentation for what GPIO pins have which alternate functions?

Post-lab Questions:
----------------------------

Using a timer clock source of 8 MHz, calculate PSC and ARR values to get a 60 Hz interrupt.
	Note that this is tricky because 60 Hz can't achieved exactly. You will have to think about the process and try to minimize the error. There are multiple combinations of PSC and ARR values that are acceptable answers. 
	
Look through the Table 13 "STM32F072x8/xB pin definitions" in the chip datasheet and list all pins that can have the timer 3 capture/compare channel 1 alternate function.

	If the pin is featured on the LQFP64 package that we are using, list the alternate function number that you would use to select it.
 	

Measured value of timer UEV interrupt period from first experiment

Describe what happened to the duty-cycle as the CCR value increased in PWM mode 1
	
Describe what happened to the duty-cycle as the CCR value increased in PWM mode 2
	
Include a logic analyzer screenshot of one PWM capture (doesn't matter which) 
	
What PWM mode is shown in figure 4.6 of the lab manual? (PWM mode 1 or 2)

About Timers
	Last lab introduced the Systick timer and modified its interrupt
	Features of the systick timer (pg 23 of chip datasheet)
	Exists in the ARM core, used to generate a system tick
	
	Systick is very simple, the stm32f0 has more general-purpose timers
	in chip datasheet under Functional overview -> timers and watchdogs
		shows table of the possible timers in the chip and their capabilities

	some features/operation modes:
		overflow/underflow reload interrupt (UEV - update event)
			count up or down (or both) and trigger event/interrupt at certain points
				timer reloads to value set in auto reload register
				reload point can have a lower limit than physical size of timer register
			Make simple version of figure 75 on page 318 in the periph manual	
			one-shot/pulse mode disables timer once it triggers
				one-pulse mode is from output compare mode stopping on update event
			combination of auto reload register (makes look like smaller timer) and counting frequency combine to make period of events
			
		input capture 
			timer counts, saves counter value in register when input trigger pin changes
			used to measure external signals
			
		output compare
			timer creates compare event when counter value matches compare value
			mode used to create PWM
				auto reload value and frequency sets period of PWM
				compare value sets duty-cycle of PWM 
			
		PWM (perhaps talk about different types later?)
			what signal looks like, characteristics
			How approximates analog signal (low pass filter -> analog, LED and human eye, motor etc.. give examples but keep them simple)
			different types of PWM

	Atmel ATMega328 datasheet has better figures describing timer modes. Generate own similar to these?	(pages 98-101)
		
		
		Fancy stuff: mention, not detail
			complimentary outputs
			repetition counter
			synchronization/triggering (each other and hardware)
			dead-time
			DMA
			Quadrature Encoder interface (used in motor lab later)
			Hall sensor 
			
		
		
What do timers count?
	Clock sources
		internal 
		external pins
			works similar to the EXTI where edges are configured to trigger count
		signal from another timer
	prescalers

	
	
	
	
	size of timer
	up, down, up/down counters
	
	
Main registers in timers
	Counter register
	prescaler register
	auto-reload register
	
	

	
This is where they really need to start reading/skimming the sections in the peripheral reference manual, too much information to put directly into the lab.
	
mention that they need to look up the specific timer that they want to used
		the different groups of timers are similar, but there are minor differences between the groups
	
Work with timers 2 & 3 
	timer 2 is 32-bit
	tim3 is 16-bit
	
In lab sections...
	Introduce basic theory of topic, and provide a graphical example/figure
	provide a simple use-case
	Introduce relevant registers  
	provide location in reference manual 
		
Need section on GPIO alternate pin functions!
	Introduce why have alternate modes 
	Introduce how to look up the alternate functions a pin has
		in the datasheet 
		using STMCube
			technically cube can generate HAL libraries to configure pin modes
			only use to check conflicting pins and stuff right now
	Introduce the GPIO alternate function selection registers

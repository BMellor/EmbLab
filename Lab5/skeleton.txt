I2C
-------------------------------------

Introduction to I2C (Keep each section brief)
	History of I2C
		Speed modes/options
	Signal Connections
	Topology
	Master/Slave & Multi-Master
		Introduce Addressing

Electrical Characteristics (put some detail here, lots of questions about the GPIO output modes)
	Push-Pull vs Open Drain Outputs 
		(simplified GPIO structure of PP & OD)
	Why Open-Drain for I2C 
		(demonstrate multi-master push-pull short circuiting)
	
Basic structure of a I2C transaction
	Start Condition
	Address Frame
	Read/Write Bit
	Slave Acknowledge
	Data Frames
	Stop Condition
	Multi-transaction communication 	
		Restart Conditions
		Switching Between Read/Write
	
Using the I2C Peripheral 
	I2C timings and init flowchart pg 626.
		*Provide 

	tell what to do in a register, not name the bit
	or name bit but not register
	
	

	in i2c lab link and use printf
